/* TODO
 * Set function to use per pixel including default for constructor which can be
    given one to start with
 * Needs to be given the window dimensions to be create the 3D array
 * Needs the scene to shoot rays into. Scene must have:
    object info
    camera info
 * Spawns threads to determine some particular pixel then collects and sets
    thread returned info to the 3D array
 * Setup the OpenGL code for:
    create 2 triangles that cover screne
    create a texture from 3D array
    pass texture to OpenGL
    compile and use the simple necessary shader code
        might want to create a shader object to use here
  * render function:
    The manager basically.. at this time in the scene what does it lool like and
    display that to the GLUT window. then in the future the GLFW window I am
    given.
